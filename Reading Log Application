This project was completed as a part of Khan Academy's Intro to SQL course. In it, I created two tables: one with author information such as name and age, and the other with information about each book (title, chapters, pages)..
There were two parts to this project:
  1) To practice using the JOIN function to create a table containing both the author's name and title of all entered books and run basic queries from it
  2) To use the ALTER TABLE, UPDATE, and DELETE functions to create an imaginary SQL database for a basic application that can add or remove books from a reading list, and log whether or not they have been read

CREATE TABLE authors (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, name TEXT, age INTEGER);

INSERT INTO authors (name, age)
  VALUES("Chris Fox", 42);

INSERT INTO authors (name, age)
